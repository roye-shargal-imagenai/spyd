/**
 * Hook that listens for agent lifecycle events via tRPC subscription and updates
 * pane status indicators accordingly.
 *
 * STATUS MAPPING:
 * - Start → "working" (amber pulsing indicator)
 * - Stop → "review" (green static) if pane's tab not active, "idle" if tab is active
 * - Failed (StopFailure) → "failed" (red) - the turn died on an API error
 * - PermissionRequest → "permission" (red pulsing indicator)
 * - Terminal Exit → "idle" (handled in Terminal.tsx when mounted; also forwarded via notifications for unmounted panes)
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATIONS (External - Claude Code / OpenCode hook systems):
 *
 * 1. User Interrupt (Ctrl+C): Claude Code's Stop hook does NOT fire when the user
 *    interrupts the agent. However, the terminal exit handler in Terminal.tsx
 *    will automatically clear the "working" indicator when the process exits.
 *
 * 2. Permission Denied: No hook fires when the user denies a permission request.
 *    The terminal exit handler will clear the "permission" indicator on process exit.
 *
 * 3. Tool Failures: No hook fires when a tool execution fails. The status
 *    continues until the agent stops or terminal exits.
 *
 * Note: Terminal exit detection (in Terminal.tsx) provides a reliable fallback
 * for clearing stuck indicators when agent hooks fail to fire.
