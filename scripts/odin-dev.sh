# Only one Odin can run at a time: both use ~/.odin (same terminal-host socket
# and app-state), and Electron's single-instance lock would kill the second.
# So this quits the packaged app first - but only its UI. The terminal-host
# daemon is left running and the dev app adopts it, so open sessions stay live
# through the hot-reload loop, and through leaving dev mode: the dev daemon is
# spawned detached and is no longer torn down on quit either.
#
# A daemon running a stale terminal-host.js is still restarted, but only when
# that bundle's contents actually changed (client.ts hashes it), not on every
# rebuild - which is what used to kill every session on every restart.
